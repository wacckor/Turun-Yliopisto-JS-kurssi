            5. In the file exec5.html you can find an array of numbers. Make a function that counts, for each
            unique value of an array, how many times it appears in the array. Add the results of the function to
            an html page as a table whose left column contains the unique values of the array and the right
            column their occurrence counts in the array of exec5.html. The table should be sorted into
            ascending order by the values. You may use the function makeTable (in functions.js) for creating the
            html table.
