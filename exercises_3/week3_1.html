            /*1. In the predator-prey simulation project we need animal objects that move and interact in the
            world. In this exercise we partially implement one very simple animal. The object has as attributes
            its x- and y-coordinate (integers) and species (string). Furthermore, the animal should have a
            function “move” which causes the animal to move to any location whose x- and y-coordinates differ
            from the current one by at most one unit. There are then nine possible locations to move to,
            including the possibility of staying in the current location. As the starting position of the animal, use
            (50, 50), set species to “wolf”, implement the “move” function and execute it several times,
            showing the results (it is enough to print the locations as a string, graphical presentation is not
            required). You may implement the animal as an object literal but if you want to, you can also create
            a constructor function or a class. */

            let animal = {
                x : 50,
                y : 50,
                species : "wolf",

                move : function(){
                    let newX = Math.floor(Math.random() * (this.x + 2 - this.x + 1)) + this.x -1;
                    let newY = Math.floor(Math.random() * (this.y + 2 - this.y + 1)) + this.y -1;
                    this.x = newX;
                    this.y = newY;
                    alert(this.species + " has moved to x = "+ this.x + ", y = " + this.y + "."); 
                    
                }
            };

            //executes 8 times:
            for(let i = 0; i < 8; i++){
                animal.move();
            }
